# Media Ranker
## Learning Goals

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce the following concepts:

- Previous Rails learning, including MVC, RESTful routing, and the request cycle
- Testing Rails applications
- Building complex model logic
- Using `session` and `flash` to track data between requests
- DRYing up Rails code

## Objective

We will build a Rails webapp where users can vote for their favorite pieces of media.

In contrast to previous projects, instead of implementing a pre-defined spec, you will be imitating an existing site: http://media-ranker-2-0.herokuapp.com. Your job is to match the functionality and styling of this site as closely as possible.
